###Introduction
A system where members can be given awards to display in their profile and posts.

###Features
* This mod allows users with the permission to upload images that will serve as rewards.
* These images can be assigned a name as well as from what they were earned (Ex. Contest, or the name of a game)
* The image and the details assigned with the image are stored and can then be assigned to members.
* Awards can be uploaded, assigned, and viewed in the admin panel.
* The same image can be assigned to multiple members.
* Once assigned, the member can view his/her album, as well as others.
* They will be able to select their favorite image, as well as see who else has earned that award.
* Those with correct permissions can edit the image and information assigned to that image, as well as completely delete it.
* And more!
